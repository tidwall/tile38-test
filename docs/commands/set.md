## Full Syntax

SET key id FIELD EX type value

---

## Description

Set the value of an id. If a value is already associated to that key/id, it'll be overwritten.

## Examples

Set a simple point in latitude, longitude. 

```tile38
SET fleet truck1 POINT 33.5123 -112.2693
```

A point with [**Z** coordinate](#z-coordinate). This is application specific such as elevation, or a timestamp, etc.

```tile38
SET fleet truck1 POINT 33.5123 -112.2693 245.0
```

A [minimum bounding rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_rectangle). The values are (southwest latitude, southwest longitude, northeast latitude, northeast longitude).

```tile38
SET props house1 BOUNDS 33.7840 -112.1520 33.7848 -112.1512 
```

A [Geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash). A geohash is a convenient way of expressing a location (anywhere in the world) using a short alphanumeric string, with greater precision obtained with longer strings.

```tile38
SET props area1 HASH 9tbnwg
```

A [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) object. GeoJSON is an industry standard format for representing a variety of object types including a point, multipoint, linestring, multilinestring, polygon, multipolygon, geometrycollection, feature, and featurecollection. Tile38 supports all of the standards with these exceptions.

1. The **crs** member is not supported and will be ignored. The CRS84/WGS84 projection is assumed.
2. Any member that is not recognized (including **crs**) will be ignored.
3. All coordinates can be 2 or 3 axes. Less than 2 axes or more than 3 will result in a parsing error.

<i>* All ignored members will not persist.</i>

**Important to note that all GeoJSON coordinates are in Longitude, Latitude order.**

```tile38
SET cities tempe OBJECT {"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.9787,33.4411],[-111.8902,33.4377],[-111.8950,33.2892],[-111.9739,33.2932],[-111.9787,33.4411]]]}
```

## Options
SET supports a set of options that modify its behavior:

- EX seconds -- Set the specified expire time, in seconds.  
- NX -- Only set the object if it does not already exist.
- XX -- Only set the object if it already exist.

<a name="fields"></a>
## Fields

Fields are extra data which belongs to an object.
A field is always a [double precision floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).
There is no limit to the number of fields that an object can have.

To set a field when setting an object.

```tile38
SET fleet truck1 FIELD speed 90 POINT 33.5123 -112.2693             
SET fleet truck1 FIELD speed 90 FIELD age 21 POINT 33.5123 -112.2693
```

It's also possible to set a field when an object already exists. See [FSET](/commands/fset).

<a name="z-coordinate"></a>
## Z Coordinate
A **z** coordinate allows for optimized range queries for values such as Elevation and Timestamps.

To set the z coordinate:

```tile38
SET fleet truck1 POINT 33.5123 -112.2693 115
SET fleet truck1 OBJECT {"type":"Point","coordinates":[33.5123,-112.2693,115]}
```

Now queries can search the z coordinate by treating it as a field:

```tile38
NEARBY 1 WHERE z -15 130 POINTS 33 -115 100000
```

Which will look for all points that are within 100 kilometers of 33,-115 and have a `z` coordinate between -15 and 130.
**notice the lowercase `z` in the WHERE clause**





<a name="strings"></a>
## Strings

It's possible to set a raw string by using the STRING keyword.
The value of a string type can be plain text or a series of raw bytes.
To retrieve a string value you can use [GET](/commands/get), [SCAN](/commands/scan), or [SEARCH](/commands/search).

```tile38
SET fleet truck1:driver STRING "John Denton"
```

A [geofence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence) is a virtual boundary that can detect when an object enters or exits the area. This boundary can be a radius or any [search area format](/commands/intersects#area-formats), such as a [bounding box](/topics/object-types#bounding-box), [GeoJSON](/topics/object-types#geojson) object, etc. Tile38 can turn any standard search into a geofence monitor by adding the FENCE keyword to the search. 
<br clear="all">

To demonstrate, we'll use a pubsub channel to listen for geofence notifications. Open two terminals:

## Terminal 1

Connect to the Tile38 server and create the geofence using the
[`SETCHAN`](/commands/setchan) or [`SETHOOK`](/commands/sethook) command.

In this example we use a pubsub channel.

```tile38-cli
$ tile38-cli
localhost:9851> SETCHAN warehouse NEARBY fleet FENCE POINT 33.462 -112.268 6000
{"ok":true,"elapsed":"21.712µs"}
```

Subscribe on the geofence pubsub channel you just created

```tile38-cli
localhost:9851> SUBSCRIBE warehouse
{"ok":true,"command":"subscribe","channel":"warehouse","num":1,"elapsed":"7.361µs"}
```

The connection will be kept open using the SUBSCRIBE command. If any object enters or exists the 6km radius around `33.462,-112.268` the server will respond in realtime with geofence notifications.

## Terminal 2

Connect to the Tile38 server and create a point in the `fleet` collection that will trigger a geofence notification

```tile38-cli
$ tile38-cli
localhost:9851> SET fleet bus POINT 33.460 -112.260
{"ok":true,"elapsed":"12.988µs"}
```

The event will appear in Terminal 1 and look like:

```tile38-json
{
    "command":"set",
    "group":"5c5203ccf5ec4e4f349fd038",
    "detect":"inside",
    "hook":"warehouse",
    "key":"fleet",
    "time":"2019-01-30T13:06:36.769273-07:00",
    "id":"bus",
    "object":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.26,33.46]}
}
```

The server will notify the subscribed clients if the `command` is **`del`** or **`set`** or **`drop`**.

- **`del`** notifies the client that an object has been deleted from the collection that is being fenced.
- **`drop`** notifies the client that the entire collection is dropped.
- **`set`** notifies the client that an object has been added or updated, and when it's position is detected by the fence.

<a name="detect"></a>
The **`detect`** may be one of the following values.

- **`inside`** is when an object is inside the specified area.
- **`outside`** is when an object is outside the specified area.
- **`enter`** is when an object that **was not** previously in the fence has entered the area.
- **`exit`** is when an object that **was** previously in the fence has exited the area.
- **`cross`** is when an object that **was not** previously in the fence has entered **and** exited the area.

By default **all** detect types and commands are returned.
If you would like to only have a select few then use the `DETECT` option, for example:

```tile38
SETCHAN warehouse NEARBY fleet FENCE DETECT inside,outside POINT 33.462 -112.268 6000
```

This command will only tell the fence that you only want **inside** and **outside** detection.

It's also possible to mask which commands are returned by using the `COMMANDS` option, for example:

```tile38
SETCHAN warehouse NEARBY fleet FENCE DETECT enter COMMANDS set POINT 33.462 -112.268 6000
```

This specifies that you only want the **enter** detection for the **set** command.

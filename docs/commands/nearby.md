## Description

The NEARBY command searches a collection for objects that are close to a specified point. The KNN algorithm is used instead of the standard overlap+Haversine algorithm, sorting the results in order of ascending distance from that point, i.e., nearest first.

This command has many options, but at it's most simplest it may appear like:

```tile38-cli
NEARBY fleet LIMIT 1 POINT 33.462 -112.268
```
to find the object closest to the given point.

If the radius is given:
```tile38-cli
NEARBY fleet POINT 33.462 -112.268 6000
```
then the search will be limited by that radius, in this case `6000` meters.
